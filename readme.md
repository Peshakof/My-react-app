Project name: Money tracker

Personal Finance Application That Makes Money Management Easy:

You can add your personal expenses and your incomes. You can add them by date, category, amount or a brief description. This app also allows you to edit your information or delete it whenever you like. Another option that this app has is to view a detailed chart in the form of a donut. Last but not least, you can search in this app by timeframe.

Installation Process:

This project consists of two basic folders i.e. "client" and "server". 
In each of these two folders we open a new terminal and we type in a command "mpm install", in order to install all of the packages that are required for the project to run. After that to run the project we type in a command "mpm start" in both terminals.
